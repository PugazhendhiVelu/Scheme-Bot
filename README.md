In a period of digitalization and automation, the accessibility of government schemes and benefits plays a crucial role in ensuring citizens welfare and empowerment. 
This project aims to develop a user-friendly chatbot interface designed to provide comprehensive information about government schemes, eligibility criteria, and engagement process. 
The chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand user queries and provide relevant information that is obtained from multiple government websites through web scraping. 
Through a user-friendly interface, citizens can easily explore a variety of scenarios and obtain information that is specifically adapted to their needs and circumstances.


**Technologies Used**
* Python
* Natural Language Processing (NLTK) libraries
* Web scraping Selenium
