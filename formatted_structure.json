This will significantly address the infrastructural problems confronted by students on day to day basis. The Scheme is being implemented through the Indian Institute of Technology\u2013 Guwahati.\n\nb. North East India largely has hilly regions where the supply of water is not regular throughout the year and during the dry season, there is no secured water supply in the institutes. Water harvesting projects are supported under the Scheme for assured water even during the dry season.\n\nc. Most of the urban and rural areas in North Eastern India are deprived of continuous electricity supply, which not only affects daily life but also imparting of higher technical education. The scheme makes the provision of installations for captive solar power energy; at places where the solar energy is not effective, procurement of generators can be considered. Such support will make the technical institutes function better by meeting the shortage of conventional electricity supply:\n\nd. The availability/ connection of the internet facility is also not up to the desired level in North Eastern Region. To mitigate this problem, funding \nfor setting up an initial internet connection is considered under the Scheme. Recurring expenditures for the future shall have to be borne by the institution.\n\n\nObjective\nTo enhance the functional efficiency of the technical institutes located in far-flung areas of North East India, by addressing deficiencies in water, electricity, and internet connectivity on the campuses."
